This was a project for my Senior Seminar class at University of South Carolina Upstate. The goal was to analyze two different types of algorithms using objective metrics to determine which one was superior. The abstract is included below, and the rest of the paper can be found in the "Symmetric Encryption Comparison" pdf document. All of the code used can be found in this repository.

# ABSTRACT
Society runs on secrets. When sending emails, using an ID to enter a building, or even using a debit card, encryption is used to keep your information safe. Without encryption, data can be easily read and used to maliciously gain access to systems and wreak havoc. The development of strong encryption methods ensures that our society can continue to function. 
There are many different methods of encryption, some of which are more easily cracked than others. There is a trade-off between security, speed, processor usage, power consumption, and memory utilization. 
This research aims to explore the differences between two popular symmetric encryption techniques: Substitution Permutation Networks and Stream Ciphers.
